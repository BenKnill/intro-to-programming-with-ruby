Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}
What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

The difference is that in the first case you are making a hash with :x as the key, while in the second case
the value stored by the variable x is the key.
